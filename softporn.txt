### M 1   P 1    in a Hallway

I'm in a dimly lit hallway.
The paint is peeling off the walls and the floor hasn't been cleaned in months.
Cockroaches run across the floor - jumping as the loosely installed lightbulb
crackles and flickers.
An old desk sits pushed against the wall.  A businessman sits on a broken chair
next to the desk.  Seems kind of drunk!

### M 2   P 2    in a Bathroom

I'm in a bathroom.
The stench is unbelievable!!!!  Graffiti is all over the walls.  Cockroaches
don't seem to survive in this place - their dead bodies are strewn everywhere.
The sink's faucets are broken - in fact the sink hangs from the wall by its
rusted plumbing.
A toilet sits in the corner.  This baby looks dangerous!!

### M 3   P 3    in a Sleazy Bar

I'm in a sleazy bar.
Behind the bar sits a bartender.
A sign hanging over him says:  'Beer $100  Whiskey $100'.
The place isn't furnished too well.  A curtain hangs on one wall.
Next to the curtain is a button.
A fan whirls slowly overhead - moving the stagnant air around.

### M 4   P 4    on a Street outside the Bar

I'm on the sidewalk outside the bar.
A couple stray dogs wander around.  A cat is crouched in the entrance watching
the dogs.
Old beat-up cars drive by.  The sirens of police cars and ambulances wail in
the distance.
Some paper blows by - from the overfilled garbage dumpster next to me.
I just miss stepping on a dogs "calling card".  The dogs look at me -
I hope they don't think I'm a fire hydrant!

### M 5   P 5    in the Backroom

I'm in the backroom of the bar.
There's this big dude in here with me.
He's wearing a button.  I can't see what it says ... maybe I should take
a closer look at him ...
Stairs lead up to the second floor.  There's a TV in the corner also.
I get the feeling loitering is not encouraged here!

### M 6   P 6    in a Filthy Dumpster!

There's a fire escape ladder above me which lowers automatically whenever
weight is put on it.  As a result I find myself in the garbage dumpster
which some fool placed under it!  The trash in this thing is foul!!
I'm sitting in a sea of coffee grinds and egg shells.  Various pieces of
trash surround me................................
I don't like this - I think I may throw up!!!!

### M 7   P 7    inside the Room I broke into

I'm in the room I broke into!
The entrance (on the far side of the room) is locked shut.  Through the door's
peephole I see a hallway with people in it.  So that won't make a good exit!
The plaster's falling off the wall ..... the usual decor for this building.
Through the window leads the safety rope I'm using.

### M 8   P 8    on a Window Ledge

I'm on a window ledge.
My safety rope leads back to the fire escape.  While it helps me some I could
still fall and kill myself ... so be careful!!!!
The window looks into a room.  But I can't see too much from here.

### M 9   P 9    in a Hooker's Bedroom

I'm in a seedy bedroom.
There's a hooker in here also.  The bed's a mess and the hooker's about
the same!
The room is painted bright pink and the ceiling is covered with mirrors!
A fire exit is to the north.
A sign says:  'Take precautions!  The clap could be fatal!'

### M 10  P 10   on a Hooker's Balcony

I'm on a balcony.
Off in the distance I see a brightly lite billboard.  A fire escape ladder
is at one end of the balcony.  A sign says  'Use only in extreme emergency!!!'
Looking over towards the west end of the balcony I see a window ledge.
It looks too dangerous to go there - I might fall!

### M 11  P 11   on a Downtown Street

I'm on a downtown street.
People from all walks of life are milling about.  Cadillacs, Limos and
Mercedes sportcars drive up and down the street bringing gamblers to
and from the casinos.
To the north is an establishment - an advertiesemnt says:
'Use our services to enter into a blissful life!'
To the east is 'The Adventurers Hotel'.  Seems like quite the classy place!

### M 12  P 12   in a Quickie Marriage Center

I'm in a quickie marriage center.
A flashing neon sign says:  'Why wait?  Marry the girl of your dream today!!!
You provide the girl - we provide a legal marriage for only $1000!!'.
A plaque hangs below the sign, procaliming - 'Over 1 million served!!!'

### M 13  P 13   in the Main Casino Room

I'm in the main casino room.
Row upon row of slot machines fill the room.  The bells of the slot machines
clamor as winnings are paid out to the winners.  The police cart off one of
the losers.  Vagrancy is not tolerated here - vagrants are exterminated ...
keeps the crime rate low ...!  But everyone seems happy here .. it's a
gambler's paradise!!!!

### M 14  P 14   in the '21' Room

I'm in the 'Twenty-one room'.
Tables for playing blackjack are everywhere.  The noise of people winning
and losing fortunes fills the room.  A table stands in front of me - the
dealer waits for me to join in.
People gather ... they want to see me gamble my fortune away!
A voice within me says: 'Go for it -- fool!'.

### M 15  P 15   in the Lobby of the Hotel

I'm in the main lobby.
There's a stairway going up to the hotel desk.  The only other exit leads back
to the casino.  Over in the corner is a flourishing plant which is sitting
in a pot.  Couchs and tables are also in the room - as are other items one
would normally find in a lobby.
The lobby is empty - everybody is out gambling.

### M 16  P 16   in the Honeymoon Suite

I'm in the honeymoon suite of the hotel.
The decor is fabulous!!!  A giant heart shaped bed sits in one corner of the
room.  The floor is covered with a deep shag rug.
A tiffany lamp provides just the right amount of light to complete the
atmosphere.
A breeze flows through the curtains on the east wall.

### M 17  P 17   in the Hotel Hallway

I'm in a hallway.
Doors line each side - most have 'Do not disturb' hung on the doorknobs.
Waiters from room service pass by bringing food and drink to the hotel guests.
An ashtray stands next to the wall.  To the south is the entrance to the
Honeymoon Suite.

### M 18  P 18   on the Honeymooner's Balcony

I'm out on a porch.
A high wooden fence surrounds the porch.  There's a little hole in the fence.
An arrow points at it - written next to it is a message - 'Look here!'.
The sun is out - it's rays beat down on the porch making it very hot.

### M 19  P 19   at the Hotel Desk

I'm at the registration counter of the hotel.
A sign says 'No vacancy'.  There's an elevator next to the counter marked
'Penthouse - private'.  A button is next to the elevator.
The smell of perfume fills the air!

### M 20  P 20   in a Telephone Booth

I'm in a telephone booth.
The directory is all ripped up and piled on the floor.  There's some numbers
scribbled on the side of the telephone.  The only ones which are legible read
'555-6969' and '555-0439'.

### M 21  P 21   in the Disco

I'm in the 'Swinging Singles Disco'.
There's a crazy DJ playing the newest hits.  The dance floor is filled with
guys and gals doin' the best steps in town.  The crowd is really getting into
it - everybody's having fun.  There's a table to stand at over by the dance
floor.
A little cardboard sign at the table says: 'Wine - $100'.

### M 22  P 22   on a Residential Street

I'm standing on a sidewalk.
To the north is a fancy doorway - the entrance to the Disco Club.
An old bum sits by the entrance - he's definitley seen better days.
The guy really looks tormented!
To the east is a pharmacy.  Apartment houses and homes line the rest of
the street.

### M 23  P 23   in the Disco's Entrance

I'm in the entrance to the disco.
Pictures line the entrance way - showing the happy singles
who attend the club.
Singles pass by me into the club.
Couples wander out - kissing and making eyes at each other.
A door is to the west.  The door has a sign on it.

### M 24  P 24   in the Pharmacy

I'm in a pharmacy.
A pharmacist sits behing the counter.  On one wall sits a magazine rack.
A sign reads 'This is not a library - no reading'.
A mirror to protect against shoplifting is mounted in the corner.
Kids stop and buy candy.  Others buy newspapers/cigarettes etc.

### M 25  P 25   in the Penthouse Foyer

I'm in the foyer of the penthouse.
Over in the corner is a spiral staircase.  Next to the elevator is a button.
The place is nicely decorated - no expense spared.
The kitchen is to the east.

### M 26  P 26   in the Jacuzzi

I'm in a jacuzzi!!!
Oh boy - does this feel good!!!
Water swirls around me - its warmth soaks into my body.  The feeling of
relaxation is almost numbing.  Over on the other side of the jacuzzi is
a most beautiful girl!!!!
I hope she doesn't mind me being here.

### M 27  P 27   in the Kitchen

I'm in the kitchen.
There's a sink to one side.  High over the sink is mounted a cabinet.
There's no dishes in sight - the place is kept quite tidy.  Real nice.
There's a little sign over the sink.

### M 28  P 28   in the Garden

I'm in a lush garden!!!
The air is filled with the aroma of all sorts of plants.  Green ferns are
everywhere.  Roses and other flowers emit their wonderful fragrances.
If ever there was a garden of Eden - this certainly has to be the place!!
The entrance disappeared just as I walked in!!!
Hmmm ... how do I get out of here!?!?!?!?!?!?

### M 29  P 29   in the Living Room

I'm in a living room.
There's a closet on one wall.
Nobody is here - but I think there is a gurgling noise coming from somewhere.
A very nice place!

### M 30  P 30   on the Penthouse Porch

I'm outside on an expansive rooftop.
The sun shines in amongst the plants and trees - birds flutter about.
There's a jacuzzi in the middle of the porch!!  Well - there's the source
of the gurgling noise!!
A wooden fence surrounds the area.



### M 31  A 1    Look hooker

Oh no!!!  I paid for this?!?!?!  This beast is really ugly!!!!  Jeezzzz....
I hope I don't get the clap from this hooker.................  Well ... she
seems to be annoyed that I haven't jumped on her yet ... go to it, stud!!!!

### M 32  A 2    Read newspaper (in hallway in bar)

It's the gambler's gazette!!
There's an article here which tells how to activate the games at the
Adventurer's Hotel.  It says that Blackjack can be played by entering
'Play 21'.  The slot machines can be started with 'Play Slot'.

### M 33  A 3    Read magazine (in pharmacy)

Hmmmm ..... an interesting magazine with a nice centerfold!
The feature article is about how to pick up an innocent girl at a disco.
It says - 'Shower her with presents.  Dancing won't hurt either.  And wine
is always good to get thing moving!'

### M 34  A 4    Look girl (in disco)

Cute and innocent!!  Just the way I like my women.
Oh - this girl is great!  She has a beautiful California tan ... and pert
little breasts ... a trim waist ..... and well rounded hips!!
I dream about getting this nice a girl.  I hope you play this game well
enough so I can have my jolly with her!
You could make your puppet a very happy man...................

### M 35  A 5    Look girl (in jacuzzi)

What a beautiful face!!!  She's leaning back in the jacuzzi with her eyes
closed and seems extremely relaxed.  The water is bubbling up around her...
She's so beautiful ........ a guy really could fall in love with a girl
like this.  I presume her name is 'Eve' ... at least that's what the towel
next to her has embrodiered on it.

### M 36  A 6    Hail taxi

A taxi pulls up and screeches to a halt!  I get in the back and sit down.
A sign says  'We service 3 destinations.  When asked, please specify -
Disco ... Casino ... or Bar'.
The driver turns and asks:  'Where to Mac???'

### M 37  A 7    Press button (at hotel desk or in penthouse foyer)

The elevator door open ... I get in.
As the doors close the music starts playing - it's the usual elevator stuff
... boring!  We start to move ... after a few seconds the elevator stops.
The doors open and I get out.

### M 38  A 8    Eat girl

She says 'Me first!!!!'
She takes my throbbing tool into her mouth!!!
She starts going to work ... feels so good!!!!!!
Then she smiles and bites it off!  She says 'No oral sex in this game!!!!!!'
Suffer!!!!!

### M 39  A 9    Give wine (to bum, who then tells his story)

Well, my son ... here's my story.
I came here many years ago - and my goals were the same as yours ... but this
adventure was too much for me!
Here's a gift ... carry it with you at all times!!!!  There's some kinky girls
in this town!!  And you never know when you may need to use this to defend
yourself!!!!  After all you may get in a program bug ......

### M 40  A 10   Look girl (voluptuous blonde)

She's wearing the tightest jeans!  Wow ... what a body!!!!!  36-24-35!!  This
girls derriere is sensational!!  And the shirt?  See through - and what I see
I like!
As my eyes reluctantly roam from her body, I see bright blue eyes - and a
smile that dazzles me.  I think she likes me!

### M 41  A 11   TV channel 1

A masked man runs across the screen.  Jumping up he lands on his horse and
yells  'Hi-ho plutonium!!!!!'  He rides off into a green sky.....
Nothing like a good old western to pass the time.

dragged to the stage...........

### M 43  A 13   TV channel 3

Throwing open the door - his face turns a deep red!!!!!!!!!
He says:  'Scotty!  What are you doing??'
Scotty replies:  'Byt Captain!?!?  My girl and I - we're engaged!!!!'
Jerk commands:  'Well, then disengage!'
... as the starship thrusted forward ... penetrating deeper into space ....

### M 44  A 14   TV channel 4

The News!!  Today the prime rate was raised once again ... to 257%!  This

The birth rate has taken a dramatic fall ... this is due to the increased
usage of computers as sexual partners..  However ... rapes of innocent people
are on the increase!  And who is the rapist??  Computerized banking machines
lead the list ... followed by home computers ....

### M 50  A 20   Give apple (to girl in jacuzzi)

She takes the apple and raises it to her mouth.  With an outrageously innocent
look she takes a small bite out of it.  A smile comes across her face!  She's
really starting to look quite sexy!!!!  She winks and lays back in the jacuzzi

### M 51  A 21   Fuck hooker (with rubber)

Oh boy!!!! - it's got 3 spots to try!!!  I thrust into the doll - kinky .. eh?
I start to increase my tempo ... faster and faster I go!!!!
Suddenly there's a flatulent noise and the doll becomes a popped balloon
soaring around the room!  It flies out of the room and disappears!

### M 53  A 23   Fuck girl (in jacuzzi, must give apple first)

She hops out of the tub - the steam rising from her skin ... her body is
the best looking I've ever seen!!!
Then she comes up to me and gives the best time of my life!!!
Well ... I guess that's it!  As your puppet in this game I thank you for
the pleasure you have brought me ... so long ... I've got to get back to
my new girl here!  Keep it up!

I close my eyes and she starts to go to work on me.......
I'm really enjoying myself when suddenly she ties me to the bed!!!!

The bathroom door opens and a girl walks out.  Holy cow!  Her boobs are huge -

Now she's taking a large sausage-shaped object and looks at it longinly!
Damn!  She shuts the curtain!

The blonde looks at the pills and says  'Thanks!!!  I love this stuff!'
She takes a pill .... her nipples start to stand up!  Wow!!!!
She's breathing heavily .... I hope she rapes me!!!!!
She says  'So long!!!  I'm going to see my boyfriend!'
She disappears down the stairs.....

### M 58  A 28   (whenever bringing wine into a taxi)

Welcome to Purgatory!!  Here at this crossroad you have three options:
Before you are three doors.  Each will bring you to a different place -

The doors are randomly different each time!!

### M 66  A 36    When married

OK.
Why am I doing this?
The Preacher takes $1000 and winks!
The girl grabs $2000 and says:

The object of SOFTPORN ADVENTURE is to find -- and seduce -- three different
girls.  They have very different personalities, so tricks that work on one
girl usually won't work on another girl.
The game has three different areas -- Disco, Casino and Bar.  You start off
in the Bar with $1000.  You'll need more money than that, so you'll have to
make more money during the game.

You give your puppet commands like 'Go north', 'Buy beer' etc.  A phrase like
'Look at the table' is equivalent to 'Look table'. Some commands can be abbre-
viated, like 'N' for 'Go north', 'L' for 'Look', 'I' for 'Inventory' etc.
To see how well you're doing, type 'Score'. To save and restore a game posi-
tion, type 'Save' and 'Restore', followed (optionally) by up to 3 characters,
specifying different saved game positions.

If you're stuck, try looking at everything in sight, object by object. This
will usually help you find missing objects and/or clues etc.
The 'Help' command will repeat this message.
Several commands can be entered on the same line, but must then be separated
by commas or periods.
